# Design Goals

* Bluetooth First!
* nRF52 features first!  Use peripherals included in the SoC instead of bit-banging and wasting CPU Cycles and burn battery for no reason.
* Must run on batteries 
* Low Power Consumption is key to long battery life
* Keep latency in check
* Don't copy/paste features from QMK or other firmware (licenses are different)
